# TicTacToe-App-with-SwiftUI
Here is a tic tac toe app using the new SwiftUI framework. This is the first app I have ever made and I wanted it to be relatively straightforward so I could build upon my knowledge. However I still believe that this is a very neat and tidy app with a clean UI and good code to power it. Almost just getting the hang of swift the game is split up into structs and classes - where the structs display the views and the classes represent the board and the minimax solver etc. The app allows you to play two player or against the computer - where the computer has three difficulty settings, powered by the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
